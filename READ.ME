# **Churn Prediction - Telco Company**

**Dataset Source**: [Kaggle - Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn?resource=download)

### **Project Overview**

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning. The goal is to analyze key factors contributing to churn, to retain customers.

**Key Performance Metrics:**
- **Test Accuracy:** 80.81%  
- **Recall:** 56.09%  

Since the priority is identifying customers who are likely to churn, **Recall** is the key metric. False positives are acceptable if it means capturing more actual churners.

### **Business Alignment**

Understanding the churn context is critical. Below are key questions to align with the business team:

#### **Understanding the Business Context**
1. **Nature of the Product/Service:**  
   - Are services focused on long-term customer loyalty or short-term relationships?

2. **Churn Impact and Metrics:**  
   - Is churn regularly calculated and its financial impact assessed?

3. **Adaptability to Findings:**  
   - Is the team open to adjusting strategies based on data insights?

4. **Existing Policies:**  
   - Are there contractual obligations, such as penalties for early termination?

5. **Customer Behavior:**  
   - What differentiates loyal customers from those who churn?

#### **Feature Engineering Considerations**
1. **Churn Hypotheses:**  
   - Are there assumptions about factors influencing churn (e.g., age, service type)?

2. **Feedback Integration:**  
   - Can customer feedback (e.g., NPS) be linked to the dataset?

3. **Segmentation and Prioritization:**  
   - Are specific segments (e.g., high-value customers) prioritized?

4. **Retention Metrics:**  
   - Are retention programs measurable, and how can they inform the model?

### **Project Workflow**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Understand data distributions, correlations, and missing values.
   - Identify key features linked to churn.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Remove highly collinear features, such as `TotalCharges`.

3. **Machine Learning Pipeline:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Use hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) to optimize the SVM model.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like Accuracy, Recall, and Precision.

4. **Output Results:**
   - Save predictions (`y-pred.xlsx`) and metrics (`metrics.xlsx`) to facilitate analysis.
